                  <span class="text-center text-grey">
                      We use cookies and similar tools across our websites to improve their performance and enhance your user experience.
                    This policy explains how we do that.
                  </span>

                  <h4 class="text-grey">What are cookies?</h4>
                  <span class="text-center text-grey">
                    Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognize your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.
                    <br /><br />
                    There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyze how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.
                    <br /><br />
                    Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites, or a user’s general location.
                  </span>

                  <h4 class="text-grey">What sort of cookies does the entertale use?</h4>
                  <span class="text-center text-grey">
                   1. Essential cookies:
                      Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For example,
                      some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages.
                      If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that
                      a subscription entitles them to.
                    <br /><br />
                    2. Performance Cookies:
                      We utilize other cookies to analyze how our visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance.
                      This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customizing our offering and quickly
                      identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to
                      keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective,
                      and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that
                      we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.
                    <br /><br />
                    3. Behaviorally Targeted Advertising Cookies:
                      entertale and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests.
                      You might see ads that target you based on your user behavior on entertale and on other sites that you visit.
                      However, we do not tell our advertisers who you are.
