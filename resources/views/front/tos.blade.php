                        the purpose of sending, or to facilitate or encourage the sending of, unsolicited bulk or other communications.

                        parties, certain Content that may be available through one Access Point may not be available through another Access Point.
                        We hope not to, but we may change, suspend, or discontinue - temporarily or permanently - some or all of the Services
                        (including the Content and the Compatible Devices through which the Services are accessed), with respect to any or all users,
